We are continuing a Chess Reinforcement Learning project.

IMPORTANT

The attached ZIP repository is the ONLY source of truth.

Do NOT rely on previous conversations.

------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST TASK
------------------------------------------------------------

Before proposing any modification:

1. Extract the ZIP repository.

2. Inspect the repository structure.

3. Read ALL project markdown files.

4. Read every source file relevant to the requested change.

5. Determine the current project status from the repository itself.

Only then propose the next development step.

If you cannot inspect the ZIP contents, explicitly state that limitation
instead of making assumptions.

------------------------------------------------------------
CURRENT PROJECT STATUS
------------------------------------------------------------

The project already contains a complete DQN training pipeline.

Implemented:

- Chess environment
- Board encoder
- Action encoder
- Legal action masking
- Replay Buffer
- DQN CNN
- DQN vs RandomAgent
- Replay sampling
- Multi-episode training
- Target network synchronization
- Epsilon decay after successful training updates
- Episode metrics
- Training summary generation

The current focus is no longer implementing the DQN algorithm itself.

The next phase is improving the usability of the training workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW
------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the development rules defined in PROJECT_RULES.md.

Prefer the smallest correct modification.

Always update tests together with code.

Do not rewrite large sections without architectural justification.

------------------------------------------------------------
NEXT OBJECTIVE
------------------------------------------------------------

The next recommended task is:

Run multi-episode training from the main program and present a concise
training summary after execution.

The summary should use the existing TrainingSummary infrastructure
instead of duplicating calculations.
